# Heads up
Since we are not supposed to upload binary files like pictures (*.png, *.raw ) to the git repo, please run the code as follows:
1. git clone the code to your local workspace: `git clone https://github.com/stella0316/Image_Processing_Optimization.git`
2. open the folder and navigate to `/ImprovedCode/`
3. manually copy `TestImage1.raw` to the folder
4. run jupyter notebook and start working on it. Cheers :beer:
